"""
    Method is illustrate the state and behavior or an object
    Method consist of a business logic which perform operations related to object

    ***** There are three types of methods: *****
    1.Instance methods
    2.Class method
    3.Static method

    Methods has different variations:
    1.Parameterized Method
    2.Non-Parameterized method

# ****************** Instance method ***********************
# Method which consist instance variable is called instance method
# Instance method always declare with self as a parameter
# self parameter points to the class and the current object instance
# Through the self parameter, instance methods can freely access attributes and other methods of the same object

# ******************* Class Method ***********************
# Method which consist of static variable (class level variables) is called Class Method
# We can declare class method explicitly with @classmethod decorator
# Class method must be declared with cls variable as a parameter
# cls parameter that points to the class and not to the object instance
# class method can be called by Class name or reference variable
# class method only has access to this cls argument, it canâ€™t modify object instance state
# Can access limited methods in the class. Can modify class specific details

    # static variable, it can be called by 'cls'/ class name/ reference variable

# ******************** Static method ***********************
# We can declare static method explicitly by using @staticmethod decorator
# We can access static methods by using class name or object reference
# We use static method when we want to call method without creating an object or instantiate an instance
# static method can neither modify object state nor class state.
# Static methods are restricted in what data they can access
# Cannot access anything else in the class. Totally self-contained code
